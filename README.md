# Mobile Robot Simulation
This project was developed for the robotics course of Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Ioannina. It is a simple simulation of a mobile robot moving from a starting position A to a desired position B, where A and B are described as coordinates in a 2D space. The simulation process is using a simple dynamic model of a mobile robot and funtamental physics equations.
